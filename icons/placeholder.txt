This directory should contain the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon32.png (32x32 pixels)  
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can generate these icons using any image editor or AI image generator.

Suggested icon design:
- Modern, clean design
- Gambling/betting theme (dice, charts, etc.)
- Blue/purple gradient to match the extension theme
- Clear at small sizes

For now, you can use simple colored squares as placeholders until you create proper icons.
